# A simple ray tracer

I'm making a ray tracer for fun.

At the moment I'm closely following the blog tutorials from [Brook Heisler's blog](https://bheisler.github.io/post/writing-raytracer-in-rust-part-1/).

## Run from command line

Run the example from the root directory with `cargo run`. This produces a file `test.png`.

## Run in browser

Run `npm serve`. This uses WebAssembly to do the ray tracing in the browser.
